    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi! Welcome to my little website. My name is Gabe Sallstrom. I am a Christian, husband to Mallory, father of Ruth, Electrical Engineer, and an elder of Bellbrook Bible Church (BBC). I graduated from Cedarville University in 2019 with my BSEE and a Bible minor. Since then, my friend Roy and I planted BBC in August of 2020 and I am currently working on my MDIV. My family lives in a small town in the midwest, Bellbrook, which is home to the Dairy Shed and Blueberry Cafe where Mal and I love to go for dates and any other occasion which can be blamed for eating ice cream or pancakes. God regenerated my heart at a young age and my prayer is that this site will be of benfit to all of God's people who love to look and linger on His Word. May God recieve all the glory as we feast on the all-satisfiying bread of life revealed in the pages of the Bible!</p>
